  <p>In media industry studies, accounts of digital game production have often been at the forefront to document and theorize conditions and transformations of how games are produced, regulated, distributed, marketed, and consumed. These accounts have typically taken a wider outlook to examine game production as a global industry that coexists with and contributes to the formation of national industries, including studio and publisher formation, geopolitics and laws, tax breaks and credits, regional regulatory frameworks, and cultural sovereignty. Few have examined contemporary cultural formations of local game production with an emphasis on relational and contextual linkages that shape articulations of place beyond physical scale and geographical space. Arjun Appadurai (1996) defined locality as a series of links between sense of social immediacy, technologies of interactivity, and relativity of context. Appadurai refers to these localities as neighbourhoods; situated communities characterized by their potential for reproduction in physical and virtual places. These neighbourhoods express geographical and virtual aspects of locality in terms of agency, sociality, and reproducibility.</p>
  <p>This special section seeks accounts that focus on relational and contextual linkages that scrutinise the tensions between local formations of game production with global technologies, nation-states, and dominant global industry monopolistic publishers and platforms. We particularly seek analyses that critically address local game production in regions which have seen scant scholarly attention to date, such as South-East Asia, South America, the Caribbean, the Middle East, and Africa. These accounts can focus on urban and economic geography; genealogies of media policy, ownership, and circumvention; online communities and translocal scenes; and the geopolitics of difference in institutional settings and places of circulation.</p>
  <p>We seek perspectives that dialogue with recent research on media industry and cultural work, such as research on creators and developers (O’Donnell 2014; Ruberg 2019), under-the-line workers (Bulut 2020; Ozimek 2019), cultural intermediaries (Parker, Whitson & Simon 2018), creator communities and scenes (Grimes 2015; Oulton 2019; Young 2021), public and regional funding schemes (Sotomaa, Jørgensen & Sandqvist 2019), content creation platforms and digital networks (Foxman 2019; Nicoll & Keogh 2019; Nieborg, Young & Joseph 2020), and regional economies (Bayeck 2019; Kerr 2017; Švelch 2021). We welcome textured, conceptually-robust contributions that examine conditions, sites, and practices of game production in local contexts across varied moments of development, manufacturing, distribution, marketing, and circulation.</p>
  <p>This special section aims to gather contributions that open new directions for the cultural study of local digital game production. Contributions in the proposed section may address one or more of the following topic areas:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>National and local communities, industries, publishers, and/or studios in South-East Asia, South America, the Caribbean, Middle East, and Africa.</li>
    <li>Non-geographic or trans-local communities of practice, such as online scenes, production genres and art practices, remote collaborations, informal networks, and transnational activities.</li>
    <li>Cottage industries and play economies in local and regional environments that run against established forms of global production and publishing (e.g., gold farming, homebrew games, smuggling and piracy, and cheat software).</li>
    <li>The relations between local cultures of production and globally-dominant platforms of distribution.</li>
    <li>Formation of economic and content policies and regulations to protect national and regional sovereignty, like media content regulation.</li>
    <li>Application of public and not-for-profit sources of funding to provide game companies and creators with financial and administrative resources through programs and tax breaks.</li>
    <li>Contemporary or historical cultures of local production in scenes, studios, publishers, factories, outsource companies, marketing firms, and cultural events like meetups, game jams, festivals, and exhibitions.</li>
  </ul>
